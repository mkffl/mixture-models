# mixture-models

Code supporting the analyses of the 2-part articles on Expectation Maximization available on my personal blog - https://mkffl.github.io/.

The code is organised as follows
- `model.py` includes functions to run Gaussian and Poisson mixture models
- `plot_utils.py` includes matplotlib functions to generate the charts in the blog articles
- `test_models.py` includes tests for the Poisson mixture model
